description: Guidelines for creating Teleport documentation issues on GitHub
---

When you notice that something is vague, inaccurate, or incomplete about the
documentation, or have an idea for a great guide, we encourage you to create a
GitHub issue.

[Issue: Documentation](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation.md)

To help us organize our time responding to issues and pull requests, please add the `documentation` label if you are proposing or making a change to the documentation. 

You can help us estimate the time it will take to plan or review a change by adding one of the following labels:

|Label|Meaning|
|:---|:---|
|docs-new|Requires creating a new docs page|
|docs-edit|Requires editing an existing docs page (perhaps substantially)|
|docs-plumbing|Changes to how we build, display, and deploy the docsâ€”may involve [gravitational/next](https://github.com/gravitational/next)|
|docs-minor-tweak|Straightforward change to a single paragraph or code snippet|
|docs-assess-scope|Need to assess the scope of the project before starting work|
