Documentation is essential for learning about a product or service. Even for
internal contributors, reference documentation is often the ultimate source of
truth and the final arbiter of disputes and disagreements. And for decision
makers at organizations evaluating solutions, documentation is often a key
resource.

Teleport emphasizes accuracy and user satisfaction in our documentation, and
does not use documentation as a marketing tool. Our documentation supplements
other support mediums like Stack Overflow, discussion forums, GitHub issues,
Slack, and so on. There are many customer voices and we want to hear them all.
As such, we provide several avenues for expression, questions, and feedback.

Read through Divio's documentation to get a sense about
the kind of documentation we want to transform our current documentation into.
