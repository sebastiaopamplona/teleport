# Configuration and CLI reference

## teleport.yaml

`teleport.yaml` fields related to Desktop Access:

{/* NOTE to devs: If you update this reference yaml, you likely want to mirror the changes in docs/pages/setup/reference/config.mdx */}

```yaml
# Main service responsible for Desktop Access.
#
# You can have multiple Desktop Access services in your cluster (but not in the
# same teleport.yaml), connected to the same or different Active Directory
# domains.
(!docs/pages/includes/desktop-access/desktop-config.yaml!)
```

This `host_labels` configuration would apply the `environment: dev` label to a
Windows desktop named `test.dev.example.com`, and the `environment: prod` label
to a desktop named `desktop.prod.example.com`.

## Deployment

The Windows Desktop Service can be deployed in two modes.

In *direct* mode, Windows Desktop Services registers directly with the Teleport
Auth Server, and listens for desktop connections from the Teleport Proxy. To
enable direct mode, set `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` in
`teleport.yaml`, and ensure that `teleport.auth_servers` points directly at the
auth server. Direct mode requires network connectivity from the Teleport Proxy
to Windows Desktop Service, and from Windows Desktop Service to the auth server.

In *IoT mode*, Windows Desktop Service only needs to be able to make an outbound
connection to a Teleport Proxy. The Windows Desktop Service establishes a
reverse tunnel to the proxy, and both registration with the auth server and
desktop sessions are performed over this tunnel. To enable this mode, ensure
that `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` is *unset*, and point
`teleport.auth_servers` at a Teleport Proxy.

## RBAC

Teleport's Role-based access control (RBAC) allows administrators to set up
granular access policies for Windows desktops connected to Teleport.

Teleport's "role" resource provides the following instruments for controlling
desktop access:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
    # Specify whether or not to record the user's desktop sessions.
    # Desktop session recording is enabled if one or more of the user's
    # roles has enabled recording. Defaults to true if unspecified.
    # Desktop sessions will never be recorded if auth_service.session_recording
    # is set to 'off' in teleport.yaml or if the cluster's session_recording_config
    # resource has set 'mode: off'.
    record_sessions:
      desktop: true

    # Specify whether clipboard sharing should be allowed with the
    # remote desktop (requires a supported browser). Defaults to true
    # if unspecified. If one or more of the user's roles has disabled
    # the clipboard, then it will be disabled.
    desktop_clipboard: true
  allow:
    # Label selectors for desktops this role has access to.
    # See above for how labels are applied to desktops.
    windows_desktop_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    # Windows user accounts this role can connect as.
    windows_desktop_logins: ["Administrator", "{{internal.windows_logins}}"]
```

It is possible to use wildcards (`"*"`) to match all desktop labels.

Like with SSH access, the `windows_desktop_logins` field supports the special
`{{internal.windows_logins}}` variable for local users which will map to any
logins that are supplied when the user is created with
`tctl users add alice --windows-logins=Administrator,DBUser`.

For new clusters, the `access` role will have
`windows_desktop_logins: ["{{internal.windows_logins}}"]` set by default.
