Teleport uses the concept of "authentication connectors" to authenticate users
when they execute [`tsh login`](./cli.mdx#tsh-login) command. There are three
types of authentication connectors:

## Local

Local authentication is used to authenticate against a local Teleport user
database. This database is managed by [`tctl users`](./cli.mdx#tctl-users-add)
command. Teleport also supports second-factor authentication (2FA) for the local
connector. There are several possible values (types) of 2FA:

- `otp` is the default. It implements [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
  standard. You can use [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
  or [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or any other TOTP client.
- `webauthn` implements the [Web Authentication standard](https://webauthn.guide) for utilizing
  second factor authenticators and hardware devices.
  You can use [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/), [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/) or any other authenticator that
  implements FIDO2 or FIDO U2F standards.
  See our [Second Factor - WebAuthn](../../access-controls/guides/webauthn.mdx) guide for detailed
  instructions on setting up WebAuthn for Teleport.
- `on` enables both TOTP and WebAuthn, and all local users are required to have at least one 2FA device registered.
- `optional` enables both TOTP and WebAuthn but makes it optional for users. Local users that register a 2FA device will
  be prompted for it during login. This option is useful when you need to gradually enable 2FA usage before switching
  the value to `on`.
- `off` turns off second-factor authentication.

You can modify these settings in the static config `teleport.yaml` or using dynamic configuration resources:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Static Config (self-hosted)">
  ```yaml
  auth_service:
    authentication:
      type: local
      second_factor: off
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dynamic resources (all editions)">
  Create a file `cap.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  kind: cluster_auth_preference
  metadata:
    name: cluster-auth-preference
  spec:
    type: local
    second_factor: "on"
    webauthn:
      rp_id: 'example.teleport.sh'
  version: v2
  ```

  Create a resource:

  ```code
  $ tctl create -f cap.yaml
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
  
<Admonition type="note">
  SSO users can also register 2FA devices, but Teleport will not prompt them for 2FA during login. Login 2FA for SSO users should be handled by the SSO
  provider.
</Admonition>

## GitHub

This connector implements Github OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. Please refer to GitHub documentation on [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)
to learn how to create and register an OAuth app.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: github
```

See [Github OAuth 2.0](../admin/github-sso.mdx) for details on how to configure it.

## SAML

<Admonition type="note">
You need Enterprise edition of Teleport for this option.
</Admonition>

This connector type implements SAML authentication. It can be configured against any external identity manager like Okta or Auth0. This feature is only available for Teleport Enterprise.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: saml
```

### OIDC

<Admonition type="note">
You need Enterprise edition of Teleport for this option.
</Admonition>

Teleport implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which is similar to SAML in principle.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: oidc
```
