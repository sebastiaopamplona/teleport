h1: Joining Nodes and Proxies in AWS
---

This guide will explain how to set up Teleport Nodes and Proxies to join your
Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets when they are running in AWS.

<Admonition type="note">
You can also configure Nodes running in AWS to join a cluster via secret tokens,
which is useful when you don't want to rely on AWS-specific APIs.
Read more in the following guide:
[Adding Nodes to the cluster](../admin/adding-nodes.mdx)
</Admonition>

There are two AWS join methods available depending on your use case.

The **EC2 join method** is available in Teleport 7.3+ self-hosted.
It is available to any Teleport Node or Proxy running on an EC2 instance.
Only one Teleport Node or Proxy per EC2 instance may use the EC2 join method.
IAM credentials with `ec2:DescribeInstances` permissions are required on your
Teleport Auth server.
No IAM credentials are required on the Nodes or Proxies.

The **IAM join method** is available in Teleport 8.3+ cloud or self-hosted.
It is available to any Teleport Node or Proxy running anywhere with access to
IAM credentials, such as an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role.
No specific permissions or IAM policy is required: an IAM role with no attached
policies is sufficient.
No IAM credentials at all are required on the Teleport Auth server.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version=) Cloud, Open Source, or Enterprise. (Cloud does
  not support the EC2 join method.)
- A running Teleport cluster for the Node to join.
- An AWS EC2 instance to act as the Node, with the Teleport binary installed.

## Step 1/4. Set up AWS IAM credentials

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
Every Node or Proxy using the IAM method to join your Teleport cluster needs AWS
IAM credentials in order to call the `sts:GetCallerIdentity` API. No specific
IAM policy or permissions are needed. Any IAM user or role can call this API.

If running your Node on an EC2 instance, it is sufficient to attach any IAM
role to the instance. To attach an IAM role from the EC2 dashboard, select
`Actions > Security > Modify IAM role`.

You can also provide the IAM credentials to Teleport through a shared
configuration file or environment variables. For details, see the following guide:

[Specifying Credentials](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="EC2 Method">
Teleport Auth needs permission to call `ec2:DescribeInstances` in order to check
that the EC2 instances attempting to join your cluster are legitimate and
currently running.

### Step 1.1. Create the IAM policy

Create the following AWS IAM policy named `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` in
your account:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
	   {
		   "Effect": "Allow",
		   "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
		   "Resource": "*"
	   }
   ]
}
```

### Step 1.2. Attach the IAM policy

If your Teleport auth server is running on an EC2 instance and already has an
attached "IAM role for Amazon EC2", add the above
`teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` to the existing role. If the instance
does not already have an attached role, create an IAM role with the above
policy and attach it to your EC2 instance running the Teleport auth server.

If you are running your Teleport auth server outside of AWS you can attach
the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` directly to an IAM user which
Teleport will use to authenticate. You can provide the IAM credentials to
teleport through a shared configuration file or environment variables, see
https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials
for details.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/4. Create the AWS Node Joining token

Configure your Teleport auth server with a special dynamic token which will
allow nodes from your AWS account to join your Teleport cluster.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
Under the hood, Nodes will prove that they are running in your AWS account by
sending a pre-signed `sts:GetCallerIdentity` request to the Teleport Auth Server. The
Node's identity must match an allow rule configured in your AWS Node Joining
Token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your AWS
account and the ARN that your Node's identity must match.

```
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: iam-token
  # set a long expiry time, the default for tokens is only 30 minutes
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required
  roles: [Node]

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which nodes may join from
  - aws_account: "111111111111"
  # multiple allow rules are supported
  - aws_account: "222222222222"
  # aws_arn is optional and allows you to restrict the IAM role of joining nodes
  - aws_account: "333333333333"
    aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-node-role/i-*"
```

The optional `aws_arn` field in the allow rules supports wildcard characters:
- `*` to match any combination of characters
- `?` to match any single character

See the
[IAM docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.html)
for more details on the ARN format.

You can check what your AWS identity looks like by running
`aws sts get-caller-identity` on the
[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="EC2 Method">
Under the hood, Nodes will prove that they are running in your AWS account by
sending a signed EC2 Instance Identity Document which matches an allow rule
configured in your AWS Node Joining Token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your AWS
account and the AWS regions in which your EC2 instances will run.

```
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: ec2-token
  # set a long expiry time, the default for tokens is only 30 minutes
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required
  roles: [Node]

  # aws_iid_ttl is the amount of time after the EC2 instance is launched during
  # which it should be allowed to join the cluster. Use a short TTL to decrease
  # the risk of stolen EC2 Instance Identity Documents being used to join your
  # cluster.
  aws_iid_ttl: 5m

  allow:
  - aws_account: "111111111111" # your AWS account ID
    aws_regions: # use the minimal set of AWS regions required
    - us-west-1
    - us-west-2
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Run `tctl create token.yaml` to create the token on the auth server.

## Step 3/4. Configure your Nodes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
The IAM join method can be used for Teleport services running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, or Database Service.

Configure your Teleport Node with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: iam` as shown in the following example config:

```
# /etc/teleport.yaml
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: iam-token
    method: iam
  auth_servers:
  - https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="EC2 Method">
The EC2 join method can be used for Teleport services running SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, or Database roles. The service should be run directly
on an AWS EC2 instance and must have network access to the AWS EC2 IMDSv2
(enabled by default for most EC2 instances).

Configure your Teleport node with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: ec2` as shown in the following example config:

```
# /etc/teleport.yaml
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: ec2-token
    method: ec2
  auth_servers:
  - https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Launch your Teleport Node

Start Teleport on the node and confirm that it is able to connect to and join
your cluster. You're all set!

<Admonition type="note">
When launching your first Node using the EC2 join method, you may need to
temporarily configure a higher `aws_iid_ttl` value in the AWS Node Joining token
so that you have time to get Teleport set up and configured. This feature works
best once Teleport is configured in an EC2 AMI to start automatically on launch.
You can edit the `aws_iid_ttl` value by editing the token yaml file and
re-running `tctl create -f token.yaml`.

## Next Steps

### Configuring the EC2 join method for Multiple AWS Accounts

<Admonition type="note">
This section is not necessary when using the IAM join method, multiple accounts
are support by default.
</Admonition>

In order for Teleport nodes to join from EC2 instances in AWS accounts other
than the account in which your Teleport auth server is running, Teleport must
have permissions to assume an IAM role in each of those accounts and call
`ec2:DescribeInstances` in the foreign account.

In each AWS account where your EC2 instances will be running:

1. Create the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` from [Step 1.1](#step-11-create-the-iam-policy).

2. Create an IAM role `teleport-DescribeInstances-role` that can be assumed from
   the account where your Teleport auth server is running.

   Go to the AWS IAM Console, select Create Role, and for "Select type of
   trusted entity" select "Another AWS account" and enter the AWS Account ID of
   the account where your Teleport auth server is running.

   Attach the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` to the role.

In the AWS account where your Teleport auth server is running:

1. Create an IAM policy named `teleport-AssumeRole-policy` with an `AssumeRole`
   statement for each foreign account:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
        }
   ]
}
```

2. Attach this `teleport-AssumeRole-policy` to the IAM role your Teleport auth
   server has credentials for, see [Step 1.2](#step-12-attach-the-iam-policy).

When creating the AWS Node Joining token, include an allow rule for each foreign
account and specify the AWS ARN for the foreign
`teleport-DescribeInstances-role`.

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: ec2-multiaccount-token
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  roles: [Node]
  aws_iid_ttl: 5m
  allow:
  - aws_account: "222222222222"
    aws_regions:
    - us-west-1
    - us-west-2
    aws_role: "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
  - aws_account: "333333333333"
    aws_regions:
    - us-west-1
    - us-west-2
    aws_role: "arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
```
